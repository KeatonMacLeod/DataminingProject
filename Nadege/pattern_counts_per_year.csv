number of patterns,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
numbers staying the same means pattern is stable through years,,,,,,,,,
numbers decreasing means changes/differences in patterns,,,,,, ,,,
if the 3-year intersect without 2014 is significantly higher than the 4 -year intersect then maybe older 2014 patterns are no longer relevant to more recent patterns,,,,,,,,,
