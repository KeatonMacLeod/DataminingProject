number of patterns,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
numbers staying the same means pattern is stable through years,,,,,,,,,,
numbers decreasing means changes/differences in patterns,,,,,, ,,,,
if the 3-year intersect without 2014 is significantly higher than the 4 -year intersect then maybe older 2014 patterns are no longer relevant to more recent patterns,,,,,,,,,,
